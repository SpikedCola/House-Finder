House Finder
==========

Draw a rectangle on a Google Map to find MLS listings in that area. 


Features
========

- ability to filter by lot size (minimum size in 1 direction, in feet)
- get extra information, like "Heating Fuel", "Age of the home", etc. all in one place
- every column in the table is sortable - just click the heading
- ignore listings you have ruled out
- view all photos for each listing without having to leave the page


To do:
======

- arbitrary shape selection (APIs I've seen work with a boundary rectangle; probably have to find largest enclosing rectangle of the shape and filter listings after request comes back)
- integrate Remax/Comfree/whomever else I can find
- fix little bugs (not thoroughly tested yet!)


Sample:
=======

(In this sample, minimum lot size has been set to 100'):
